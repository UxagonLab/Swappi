 **🔹The Problem**
 
 University students are often required to buy expensive tools, equipment, and study materials for specific courses.  
The issue is:  

- These items are only used for one semester or even a few weeks.  
- After that, they end up sitting unused, gathering dust, or being completely wasted.  
- Meanwhile, new students who take the same courses later are forced to buy the exact same items again at high prices, which creates financial pressure.  

This leads to:  
- Unnecessary financial burden on students.  
- Waste of resources (items are left unused).  
- Lack of accessibility for students who cannot afford the required tools.  


 **🔹The Solution – Swappi**
 
Swappi provides a peer-to-peer rental platform designed for students. Instead of buying tools that they will only use for a short time, students can:  
- Rent the tools they need directly from other students at an affordable price.  
- Lend out their unused tools and earn extra money instead of leaving them idle.

- 
**🔹How it works:**  

1. A student lists an item they no longer use (calculator, lab coat, drawing tools, etc.).  
2. Another student can quickly rent it for the period they need.  
3. The owner earns money, the renter saves money, and the item is reused instead of wasted.  


 **🔹The Impact**
 
Swappi creates value for all students involved:  
- **Financial savings** → Renters pay much less than buying new tools.  
- **Extra income** → Owners make money from items that would otherwise sit unused.  
- **Sustainability** → Reduced waste and smarter use of resources.  
- **Community building** → Encourages a culture of sharing and helping each other.  


 **🔹 Vision**
 
Swappi aims to become the go-to platform for students to access and share resources easily. By turning wasted tools into valuable assets, we help build a smarter, more affordable, and more sustainable student life.
